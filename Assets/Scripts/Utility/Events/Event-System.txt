The event system is based on the idea of:

Listeners and Subscribables

Listeners listen to Subscribables

Subscribables are the Properties and Game Events that alert their listeners when the
value of the property is changed or the GameEvent is raised

Listeners are specifically typed except for GenericRaiser,
which needs to be explicitely called
