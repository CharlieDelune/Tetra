# Tetra

## What is this?

This is a small Unity game inspired by Tetra Master. Tetra Master was a card game first introduced in the 1999 Playstation videogame Final Fantasy IX.
It was later reintroduced in the PC/PS2 MMORPG Final Fantasy XI and eventually spun off into a standalone game.
The standalone game is gone now...

## Okay, so .... why?

I had the idea, and I told my sister about it (also a huge fan of the game) and she seemed excited, so I figured ... you know, why not?

It's a small enough project that it ought to only take a few weeks to finish and I'm confident I can make it look and play really well in that amount of time.

## Boring Tech Stuff

Created in Unity 2020.2 Alpha because I like some of the new editor features.
Art assets were purchased from a Humble Bundle sale so long ago that it might as well be the Dark Ages.

## Where's it going to live when it's done?

Actually, I think this thing is going to end up on the app store if it's good enough...
